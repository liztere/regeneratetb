title: Community Gatherings
---

Our gatherings are spaces where [[Regenerative Culture]] comes alive through authentic connection, intergenerational exchange, and collective exploration.

## Why We Gather

In a culture of fragmentation and isolation, coming together in intentional ways is itself a regenerative act. Gatherings:
- Weave networks of relationship across difference
- Create space for emergence—what wants to be born through us
- Practice the principles we're learning
- Build collective capacity for transformation

## Our Approach

### Life-Centered, Not Event-Centered
We design gatherings as **living systems**, not productions:
- Holding space for what wants to emerge
- Honoring spontaneity and organic flow
- Trusting the wisdom of the circle
- Balancing structure with openness

### Intergenerational by Design
[[Regenerative Culture]] requires exchange between generations:
- Elders sharing wisdom and perspective
- Youth bringing fresh vision and energy
- Children reminding us to play, wonder, create
- All ages learning from each other

### Place-Based Practice
Every gathering is an opportunity to deepen relationship with our [[bioregion]]:
- Meeting in places that teach us about local ecosystems
- Learning from the land itself
- Practicing [[Bioregional Design]] in how we gather

### Hands-On Learning
We learn by doing:
- Rainwater harvesting workshops
- [[Learning from Nature]] walks
- Regenerative gardening demonstrations
- Community mapping and resource sharing

## The Container We Hold

Our gatherings create a container where it's safe to:
- Ask the deeper questions
- Be vulnerable and authentic
- Explore new ideas without having all the answers
- Build relationships beyond transactional networking
- Practice [[Living Systems Thinking]] together

## Economic Experimentation

We've experimented with [[Value-for-Value Economics]]—"pay what you can" models that prioritize access and relationship over extraction. This is itself a practice of regeneration: *What if our economic exchanges enhanced life rather than commodifying it?*

## Past Gatherings
