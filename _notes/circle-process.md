title: Circle Process
---

**Circle process** is a way of gathering that honors each voice, creates space for deep listening, and allows wisdom to emerge from the collective.

In [[Regenerative Culture]], how we come together matters as much as what we do. Circle creates the container for authentic connection and collaborative emergence.

## What is Circle?

Circle is an ancient human practice of sitting together in a round formation where:
- Everyone can see everyone else
- No one is at the head
- All voices have equal value
- We speak and listen from the heart
- Decisions emerge from the whole

Circle has been used across cultures for millennia—around fires, in council lodges, in community gatherings. We're reclaiming this practice for regenerative community building.

## Core Principles

### 1. Equality in the Round

The circular form symbolizes equality:
- No hierarchy of seating
- Eye contact with all participants
- Physical equality mirrors relational equality
- Everyone belongs

### 2. Speaking from the Heart

We speak our truth:
- Honestly, vulnerably, authentically
- Not performing or posturing
- Sharing what matters, not what's expected
- Trusting the circle to hold our words

### 3. Listening from the Heart

Deep listening means:
- Being fully present
- Not planning your response while others speak
- Curiosity, not judgment
- Hearing beneath the words to the meaning

### 4. Trusting the Process

Circle has its own wisdom:
- We don't need to control outcomes
- Emergence happens in its own time
- Silence is valuable
- Not everything needs a response

### 5. Witnessing

Circle creates witnesses to our experience:
- Being seen and heard
- Holding space for each other
- Collective holding of what's shared
- No one carries their story alone

## Circle Practices We Use

### Check-In Circle

**Purpose**: Arrive fully, share where we are  
**Format**: Each person shares briefly
- How are you arriving today?
- What are you bringing with you?
- What do you need to be present?

**Why**: Transitions us from outside world to circle space, creates presence

---

### Council Circle

**Purpose**: Deep exploration of a question or topic  
**Format**: 
- Center object (candle, stone, plant) as focal point
- Opening reading or poem
- Guardian holds the space and timing
- Rounds of speaking (each person speaks once per round)
- Optional talking piece (only speaker holds it)

**Guidelines**:
- Speak from your own experience ("I" statements)
- Be lean of expression (not long stories)
- Listen without rehearsing your response
- Honor silence
- What's shared in circle stays in circle (confidentiality)

---

### Talking Circle

**Purpose**: Sharing perspectives, brainstorming, storytelling  
**Format**:
- Talking piece passes around circle
- Only person holding piece speaks
- Others listen
- May pass if you don't wish to speak
- Multiple rounds until complete

**Why**: Ensures all voices are heard, prevents domination by a few, slows down conversation to be more thoughtful

### Fishbowl Circle

**Purpose**: Small group dialogue witnessed by larger circle  
**Format**:
- Inner circle (4-6 people) dialogues
- Outer circle (everyone else) witnesses silently
- Empty chair in inner circle—anyone from outer circle can join
- When joining, someone else must leave

**Why**: Allows focused conversation while including the collective, demonstrates that witnessing is participation

---

### Circle of Hands

**Purpose**: Decision-making, consensus building  
**Format**:
- Proposal is shared
- Each person shows their level of agreement with hand signals:
  - Thumbs up: Full yes
  - Flat hand: I can live with this
  - Thumbs down: I cannot support this (block)
- Discussion focuses on concerns
- Proposal evolves based on wisdom of circle
- Continue until group finds unity

**Why**: Visual consensus-building, honors dissent as wisdom, evolves proposals collaboratively

## Circle Roles

### Guardian (Facilitator)

Holds the container:
- Tracks time and energy
- Ensures guidelines are followed
- Protects the integrity of the circle
- Doesn't dominate—serves the circle

### Scribe (if needed)

Captures key themes:
- Not a transcript, but essence
- Patterns and insights that emerge
- Decisions or commitments made

### Timekeeper (if needed)

Tracks rounds and timing, alerts guardian

## Guidelines for Circle

**What supports good circle:**
- Arrive on time
- Silence phones
- Speak from personal experience
- Be concise
- Honor confidentiality
- Respect the talking piece
- Stay present (no side conversations)

**What disrupts circle:**
- Advice-giving or fixing
- Interrupting
- Side conversations
- Checking phones
- Leaving and entering repeatedly
- Dominating airtime

## Circle at Regenerate Tampa Bay

We use circle in our [[Community Gatherings]] to:

**Create Belonging**
When everyone's voice is heard, everyone belongs. Circle is how we weave community.

**Practice [[Living Systems Thinking]]**
Circle demonstrates that wisdom emerges from relationships, not individuals. The collective knows more than any one person.

**Honor Diversity**
Every perspective matters. Young and old, experienced and beginner, outspoken and quiet—all voices enrich the whole.

**Slow Down**
In a culture of speed and reaction, circle creates space for thoughtfulness, reflection, and emergence.

**Build Trust**
Being vulnerable in circle, being witnessed, witnessing others—these create bonds that sustain community.

## The Center

Most circles have something in the center:
- Candle (light, warmth, focus)
- Plant or flowers (life, beauty)
- Stone or shell (earth, grounding)
- Cloth or scarf (creating sacred space)

The center reminds us:
- We're gathered around something larger than ourselves
- There's a focal point beyond our individual egos
- Beauty and intention matter
- This is a threshold space—different from ordinary interaction

## Beyond the Circle

The skills we practice in circle ripple outward:
- **Deep listening** in all relationships
- **Speaking authentically** in daily life
- **Honoring all voices** in meetings and decisions
- **Trusting emergence** in projects and planning
- **Creating belonging** wherever we go

Circle is not just a practice—it's a way of being in relationship.

## Starting Your Own Circle

**You don't need permission or training to circle.**

Start simple:
1. Invite 4-8 people
2. Sit in a circle
3. Place something meaningful in the center
4. Each person shares: "How are you arriving today?"
5. Explore a question together
6. Close with gratitude

As you practice, circle will teach you.

## The Deeper Pattern

[[Daniel Christian Wahl]] reminds us that [[Regenerative Culture]] emerges from healthy relationships. Circle is a practice of relating:
- To ourselves (speaking truth)
- To each other (deep listening)
- To the collective (trusting emergence)
- To the more-than-human (honoring life)

When we sit in circle, we practice the world we're creating.
