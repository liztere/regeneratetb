title: Permaculture Principles
---

**Permaculture** is a design system for creating regenerative human habitats and food systems. The word comes from "permanent agriculture" and "permanent culture"—recognizing that sustainable food systems cannot exist without sustainable cultural systems.

Permaculture gives us practical design principles for creating [[Regenerative Culture]] on the ground.

## What is Permaculture?

Permaculture is:
- A **design approach** based on observing nature
- A set of **ethics** for right relationship with Earth
- **Practical techniques** for growing food, managing water, building community
- A **framework** for [[Bioregional Design]]
- A **movement** of people creating regenerative systems worldwide

Permaculture is [[Living Systems Thinking]] applied to design.

## The Three Ethics

### 1. Earth Care

Care for the living systems that support all life:
- Build soil
- Protect water
- Increase biodiversity
- Restore ecosystems
- Leave places healthier than you found them

*Earth care means recognizing we are part of nature, not separate from it.*

### 2. People Care

Care for ourselves and each other:
- Meet basic needs sustainably
- Support community wellbeing
- Ensure equity and justice
- Create meaningful livelihoods
- Honor all generations

*People care recognizes that humans thrive when communities and ecosystems thrive.*

### 3. Fair Share

Share surplus and set limits to consumption:
- Redistribute wealth
- Share knowledge freely
- Gift excess
- Consume less
- Return surplus to Earth and community

*Fair share recognizes we live on a finite planet—enough for everyone's need, not everyone's greed.*

These ethics align with [[Regenerative Culture]]—creating systems that enhance life for all.

## The 12 Design Principles

*Developed by David Holmgren, co-originator of permaculture*

### 1. Observe and Interact

**"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"**

- Slow down and observe before acting
- Nature reveals patterns when we pay attention
- Understand the system before intervening
- Every place is unique—learn from it

This is [[Learning from Nature]] as first principle.

*In Tampa Bay*: Observe seasonal patterns, water flow, sun angles, wind direction, [[Native Species Guide|native species]] before designing.

---

### 2. Catch and Store Energy

**"Make hay while the sun shines"**

- Capture resources when abundant
- Store for times of scarcity
- Solar energy, rainwater, seeds, knowledge
- Build resilience through storage

*In Tampa Bay*: 
- Rain barrels for intense summer storms
- Solar panels for year-round sun
- Food preservation for hurricane season
- Seed saving from successful plants

---

### 3. Obtain a Yield

**"You can't work on an empty stomach"**

- Design systems that produce
- Ensure basic needs are met
- Multiple yields from each element
- Some yields immediate, some long-term

*In Tampa Bay*:
- Food forests producing fruit, nuts, medicine
- Chickens producing eggs + pest control + fertilizer
- Gardens providing food + beauty + habitat
- [[Community Gatherings]] yielding connection + learning + joy

---

### 4. Apply Self-Regulation and Accept Feedback

**"The sins of the fathers are visited upon the children"**

- Pay attention to consequences
- Learn from mistakes
- Self-correct before problems compound
- Listen to feedback from systems

This is understanding feedback loops from [[Living Systems Thinking]].

*In Tampa Bay*:
- If plants struggle, what is the soil telling you?
- If flooding increases, what does watershed want?
- If community engagement drops, what needs to change?

---

### 5. Use and Value Renewable Resources

**"Let nature take its course"**

- Favor renewable over non-renewable
- Solar, not fossil fuels
- Perennial plants, not annuals requiring replanting
- Living systems that regenerate themselves

*In Tampa Bay*:
- Native perennials adapted to our climate
- Solar energy (we have plenty!)
- Rainwater (free from sky)
- Compost (waste becomes resource)

---

### 6. Produce No Waste

**"A stitch in time saves nine" / "Waste not, want not"**

- Value all outputs
- Waste = resource in wrong place
- Cycle everything back
- Design for closed loops

Nature has no concept of waste—everything is food for something else.

*In Tampa Bay*:
- Compost food scraps --> soil --> food
- Chicken manure --> fertilizer --> plants --> food --> scraps (cycle)
- Greywater --> landscape irrigation
- Fallen leaves --> mulch --> soil building

---

### 7. Design from Patterns to Details

**"Can't see the forest for the trees"**

- Observe large patterns first
- Details emerge from understanding pattern
- [[Pattern Literacy]]—see patterns across scales
- Copy nature's patterns

*Patterns in Tampa Bay*:
- Wet/dry seasonal cycles
- Branching patterns in trees, rivers, roots
- Edge effects (coastal transition zones)
- Succession from bare ground to forest

Design with these patterns, don't fight them.

---

### 8. Integrate Rather Than Segregate

**"Many hands make light work"**

- Everything works with everything else
- Place elements in relationship
- Cooperation, not isolation
- Each element supports multiple functions

This is [[Living Systems Thinking]]—relationships create resilience.

*In Tampa Bay*:
- Chickens + garden: chickens eat pests, provide fertilizer, turn compost
- Trees + house: shade reduces cooling costs, leaves mulch garden
- [[Community Gatherings]] + learning + ecosystem: connections create resilience

---

### 9. Use Small and Slow Solutions

**"The bigger they are, the harder they fall" / "Slow and steady wins the race"**

- Start small, scale gradually
- Slow solutions are more sustainable
- Small systems easier to maintain
- Less energy required

*In Tampa Bay*:
- Start with one garden bed, not whole yard
- Begin with easy natives, expand to challenging
- Build community one conversation at a time
- Small experiments teach lessons

---

### 10. Use and Value Diversity

**"Don't put all your eggs in one basket"**

- Diversity creates resilience
- Multiple species, strategies, approaches
- Variety ensures something always succeeds
- Polyculture over monoculture

In [[Tampa Bay Ecosystems]], diversity is strength.

*In Tampa Bay*:
- Mix of native plants attracts diverse pollinators
- Multiple water sources (rain, well, municipal)
- Variety of food crops spreads risk
- Diversity of community members brings varied gifts

---

### 11. Use Edges and Value the Marginal

**"Don't think you are on the right track just because it's a well-beaten path"**

- Edges are most productive
- Transition zones rich with life
- Margins hold innovation
- Interface creates opportunity

See [[Pattern Literacy]] for edge effects.

*In Tampa Bay*:
- Mangrove forests (land-sea edge) most productive
- Ecotones between ecosystems richest
- Garden edges near woods attract wildlife
- Community edges (diverse backgrounds) most creative

---

### 12. Creatively Use and Respond to Change

**"Vision is not seeing things as they are but as they will be"**

- Change is inevitable
- Observe, anticipate, adapt
- Work with succession, not against it
- Transform challenges into opportunities

[[Climate Adaptation]] is permaculture principle #12 in action.

*In Tampa Bay*:
- Plant for future climate, not just current
- Design for sea level rise
- Use hurricane disturbance to reset
- Adapt [[bioregional]] strategies as climate shifts

- Pattern of inclusion and equality


## Permaculture & Indigenous Wisdom

Permaculture was influenced by indigenous practices worldwide:
- Aboriginal Australian land management
- Pacific Islander agroforestry
- Native American food forests
- Indigenous water harvesting

**Critical recognition**:
- Permaculture builds on indigenous knowledge
- Respect and credit indigenous teachers
- Support indigenous sovereignty
- Learn from those who never forgot how to live in place

In Tampa Bay, learn from:
- Tocobaga and Calusa peoples' relationship to land
- Traditional fire management
- Oyster reef cultivation
- Seasonal patterns

## Permaculture as Regenerative Practice

Permaculture is more than techniques—it's a way of thinking and being:

**Observe before acting** --> [[Learning from Nature]]  
**Work with patterns** --> [[Pattern Literacy]]  
**Design for place** --> [[Bioregional Design]]  
**Everything connected** --> [[Living Systems Thinking]]

*"The greatest change we need to make is from consumption to production, even if on a small scale, in our own gardens. If only 10% of us do this, there is enough for everyone. Hence the futility of revolutionaries who have no gardens, who depend on the very system they attack, and who produce words and bullets, not food and shelter." - Bill Mollison*
