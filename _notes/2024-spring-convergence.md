### Network & Connect

Network with new people and teachers in our **Connections & Tea space**, where participants could search and input on a physical map of resources in the region—making visible the regenerative network across Tampa Bay.

## Our Value-for-Value Experiment

We embraced **"value for value"** pricing—a new way of thinking about exchange that puts relationships and access at the center:

### The Pricing Model

We offered:
- 💙 **Pay Nothing ($0)** - Community support ensured everyone could attend
- 💚 **Contribute a Little ($10)** - Helped cover basic costs
- 💛 **Cover Event Cost ($30)** - Standard attendance support  
- 🧡 **Support the Community ($60)** - Fair compensation for speakers and organizers, plus seed funding for future events

### Why This Approach?

From our event description:

> "We believe in the transformative power of shared experiences and the principle of 'value for value.' This event is not just about attendance; it's about shared experiences and connecting us to life."

This experimental approach helped us tell a new story of economics—putting life at the center of money. See [[Regenerative Economics]] for more on this approach.

## Key Learnings

### 1. People Hunger for Authentic Connection

In a culture of fragmentation, intentional gathering across difference creates something alive. The convergence demonstrated that [[Regenerative Culture]] isn't just theory—it's lived practice.

### 2. Intergenerational Exchange Enriches Everyone

From elders sharing wisdom to children reminding us to play, to youth bringing fresh vision—all ages together strengthened the whole.

### 3. Place-Based Learning Matters

Many attendees had never visited Sweetwater Farm before. Meeting on working land that demonstrates [[Bioregional Design]] made regenerative principles tangible and real.

### 4. Economic Experiments Shift Consciousness

The value-for-value model showed that access and relationship can be prioritized over extraction. Many participants reflected that the pricing approach itself was transformative.

### 5. Community Wants This

The energy, engagement, and feedback was clear: people are hungry for spaces like this. The convergence planted seeds for ongoing gatherings and deeper connections.

## Participant Reflections

*"This felt different from other events. People really showed up with their hearts."*

*"I loved seeing my kids learning alongside elders. That doesn't happen enough."*

*"The pay-what-you-can approach made me think differently about how we organize events and exchange value."*

*"I met so many people doing regenerative work in Tampa Bay I didn't know about. We need to connect more."*

## Looking Forward

This convergence was the beginning, not the end. It showed us:
- The appetite for regenerative gathering in Tampa Bay
- The power of [[Circle Process]] and intentional design
- The possibility of [[Value-for-Value Economics]] in practice
- The importance of [[Community Gatherings]] as foundation for culture shift

Future convergences will build on what we learned here.
