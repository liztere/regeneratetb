**Urban agriculture** brings food production into cities—transforming vacant lots, rooftops, balconies, and yards into productive landscapes that nourish people, build community, and regenerate ecosystems.

In Tampa Bay, urban agriculture is part of [[Regenerative Culture]]—creating resilient local food systems adapted to our [[bioregion]].

## Why Urban Agriculture Matters

### Food Security
- Reduces dependence on distant supply chains
- Provides fresh, nutrient-dense food
- Accessible to more people
- Resilient during disruptions (hurricanes, pandemics)

### Climate Action
- Reduces food miles (transportation emissions)
- Sequesters carbon in soil
- Cools urban heat islands
- Captures stormwater

title: Native Species Guide
---

The native species of the Tampa Bay bioregion are our neighbors, teachers, and indicators of ecosystem health. Learning to recognize and support them is essential to [[Bioregional Design]].

## Why Native Species Matter

**Ecological Relationships**
Native species have co-evolved for thousands of years, creating intricate relationships:
- Plants adapted to our soils, rainfall, and pollinators
- Animals evolved with these specific plants
- Fungi, bacteria, and insects form underground networks
- Each species supports dozens of others

**Resilience**
Natives are adapted to:
- Our seasonal wet/dry cycles
- Summer heat and humidity
- Hurricane and storm disturbance
- Periodic fire in some ecosystems
- Local soil conditions

**Cultural Connection**
These species have sustained human communities for millennia. Learning their names and relationships helps us become native to place.

## Keystone Species

Some species create habitat and conditions that many others depend on:

### Gopher Tortoise
*Gopherus polyphemus*

**The Ecosystem Engineer**
- Digs burrows up to 40 feet long
- Over 350 species use their burrows (snakes, frogs, insects, mammals)
- Burrows provide shelter from fire, heat, and predators
- Grazes on wiregrass, maintaining open pine flatwoods

**Status**: Threatened  
**Habitat**: Pine flatwoods, scrub, dry prairies  
**What they need**: Sandy, well-drained soils; native groundcover; no development

*Lesson*: One species can support hundreds. Protect the keystone, protect the community.

### Longleaf Pine
*Pinus palustris*

**The Foundation Tree**
- Once dominated 90 million acres across the Southeast
- Now less than 3% remains
- Fire-adapted with thick bark and grass stage
- Supports the most biodiverse ecosystem outside the tropics
- Provides habitat for red-cockaded woodpeckers, gopher tortoises, hundreds of plant species

**Status**: Endangered ecosystem  
**Habitat**: Well-drained sandy soils  
**What it needs**: Periodic fire (every 2-5 years), full sun

*Lesson*: Foundation species create entire ecosystems. Restore the foundation, restore the web.

**Provide water**
- Birdbath with fresh water
- Small pond for frogs
- Shallow edges for butterflies

**Leave some "mess"**
- Dead wood for beetles
- Leaf litter for insects
- Seed heads for birds
- Bare sand for ground-nesting bees

### In Your Community

**Support native habitat corridors**

- Protect remaining natural areas
- Restore degraded land

**Remove invasives**
- Brazilian pepper
- Melaleuca
- Air potato
- Torpedo grass

**Educate neighbors**

- Teach about keystone species
- Build a culture of care

## Observing Native Species

Practice [[Learning from Nature]] by:

**Keeping a nature journal**
- What species did you see today?
- What were they doing?
- What habitat were they in?
- What season is it?

**Learning scientific and common names**
- Names help us remember and notice
- Connect with place through language

**Noticing relationships**
- Which butterflies visit which flowers?
- Which birds eat which seeds?
- Who lives in gopher tortoise burrows?

**Tracking phenology**
- When do oaks bloom?
- When do spoonbills arrive?
- When does beautyberry fruit?

## Resources for Learning

**iNaturalist App**
- Free species identification
- Contribute to citizen science
- Connect with local naturalists

**Local Nature Centers**
- Boyd Hill Nature Preserve
- Weedon Island Preserve
- Sawgrass Lake Park
- Brooker Creek Preserve

**Native Plant Sales**
- Florida Native Plant Society chapters
- County extension offices
- Local native nurseries

## The Web of Life

Every native species is part of an intricate web:
- Plants feed caterpillars
- Caterpillars become butterflies
- Butterflies pollinate flowers
- Seeds feed birds
- Birds spread seeds
- Everything is connected

When we plant natives, we're not just adding plants—we're restoring relationships that have evolved over millennia.

This is [[Regenerative Culture]] in practice: participating in the web of life by supporting the species that belong here.
